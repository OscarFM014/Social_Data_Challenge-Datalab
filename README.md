* Analysis of polluting gases in Guadalajara, its causes and consequences in the city and in the people.
* Study of trends, causes and consequences of air quality levels.



## Description

### **Problem:**
* In Guadalajara there are thousands of cases of people that concern about the increase of visible contamination in certaine areas of the city.

### **Hypothesis:**
* Gudalajara has been growing for the past few yaers, and also the cars population is also increasing, that is why the contamination has been more visible in last couple of years.

### **Data:**
* **Data source**: [Historical air quality databases](https://datos.jalisco.gob.mx/dataset/bases-de-datos-historicas-de-la-calidad-del -air)

*See [Datasets](./Datasets) to access the dataset used in this project*

##Results and conclusions
We determine that the initial hypothesis was correct because we analysis the current data and we find a strong correlation on the terms we find.


## Facility
* Install dependencies with pip, the libraries used are in `requirements.txt`.
